# BALANCE Control System
The complete system is described in detail in the Documentation/ECE490_Completed_Project_BALANCE_FinalReport_MatthewEbert.pdf


The BALANCE system is a visual servoing control system which positions a ball on a ball and beam control system. This implementation uses MATLAB and a Raspberry PI to control and DC motor with a feedback signal from a raspberry pi CAM.
